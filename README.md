Is a golang based boilerplate application with Fiber Go web framework.
For any fiber go application, just clone the repo & rename the application name.

[Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) is a Go web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. Designed to ease things up for **fast** development with **zero memory allocation** and **performance** in mind. 

This boilerplate uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database service. And for authentication this boilerplate uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) where it has Access Token and Refresh Token schema.

For better coding experience, this boilerplate using [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to handle hot reloading. If you already installed [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air), you can simply run it by command,
```bash
  air
```

If not you can run, ```go run main.go```, but i don't recomend it because it sucks to re-run everytime you just need to print something ðŸ˜œ.

# For production use
It is recommended to use docker compose. Just simply run:
```bash
  docker compose up
```
